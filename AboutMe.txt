About Me
My Scientific Journey
I'm a scientist with a background in biochemistry and plant science, currently leading an Innovate UK-funded Agrivoltaics research project. My work focuses on understanding how different solar panel configurations affect crop growth and energy efficiency—a fascinating intersection of renewable energy and sustainable agriculture.

From Marine Microbes to Plant Physiology
My research journey began with marine microbiology, where I discovered and published new bacterial species from deep-sea hydrothermal environments. This early work sparked my interest in how organisms adapt to their environments at the molecular level, leading me to pursue a PhD in Biochemistry. During my doctoral research, I investigated how proteins are made and assembled in cyanobacteria, developing techniques to visualize mRNA localization and identify key proteins involved in photosynthetic machinery.

The Art and Science of Research
What I enjoy most about scientific research is the blend of technical problem-solving and creative thinking. I've found satisfaction in optimizing experimental protocols, designing data collection systems, and using Python to analyze complex datasets. Beyond the technical aspects, I value the collaborative nature of science—working with industry partners, academic colleagues, and students has enriched my perspective and approach to research questions.

Communication Across Boundaries
Outside the laboratory, I serve as a Mandarin-English interpreter for the NHS and DWP, an experience that has sharpened my ability to communicate complex information clearly across language barriers. This skill transfers well to my scientific work, where explaining technical concepts to diverse audiences is essential.

Looking Forward
As I look ahead, I'm excited to explore opportunities that bridge scientific discovery and practical application. I'm particularly drawn to roles in technology transfer and commercial assessment of research, where I can help translate scientific innovations into solutions that address real-world challenges in the life sciences.
