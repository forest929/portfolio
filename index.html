        <div class = "main-content">
            <p>
                My journey in the scientific realm has been shaped by a dedication to both rigorous academic research and proactive, community-focused engagement. With a foundation in marine microbiology and biochemistry, I have evolved from investigating complex microbial processes to optimizing data workflows and engaging with diverse stakeholders to drive innovation.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my academic and research career, I have consistently sought to bridge theory with practical applications. Whether constructing knockout mutants during my PhD in cyanobacterial research or analyzing extensive datasets in an Innovate UK-funded agrivoltaics project, I have honed a blend of technical expertise and creative problem-solving skills. A significant milestone was leading an initiative to revamp our data collection and analysis processes. By introducing a streamlined data entry format and harnessing Python to automate critical parts of our analysis, I not only improved efficiency but also enhanced cross-departmental collaboration—making complex datasets more accessible and actionable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond the lab and the computer screen, I have embraced opportunities to translate scientific concepts for wider audiences. My involvement in volunteer activities, such as supporting the “Gene-ius Fish: diving into human mental health with zebrafish” exhibit at the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition and contributing as an Oral History Research Volunteer at the Royal Museums Greenwich, has enriched my ability to communicate effectively. These experiences have allowed me to connect with the public, foster meaningful discussions about the role of science in our daily lives, and broaden my perspective on the importance of accessible scientific narratives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether collaborating across sectors on an Innovate UK-funded project or facilitating communication in high-stakes interpreter roles, I thrive at the intersection of research, communication, and community engagement. Looking ahead, I am excited to broaden my professional path and explore opportunities beyond academic research—particularly in technology transfer, the biotech industry, and the wider tech sector.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a foundation in molecular biology and microbial research, I am especially drawn to the biotech industry’s role in translating scientific discoveries into tangible health and sustainability solutions. I am equally enthusiastic about the tech industry, where my analytical thinking, problem-solving mindset, and growing programming skills can support data-driven innovation. Over the past year, I’ve expanded my technical toolkit to include Python (data visualization, workflow automation), HTML, and SQL—skills I’ve actively used to streamline research pipelines and manage complex datasets. I’m eager to apply this experience in roles that involve scientific analysis, product development, user-facing tools, or data infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, I’m driven by a desire to support impactful work—whether that’s advancing innovation, improving public understanding of science, or building systems that make knowledge more accessible and actionable. I’m open to learning, adaptable to change, and motivated by purpose-driven environments where I can continue to grow and contribute.
