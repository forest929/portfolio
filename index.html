            <p><strong>Professional Summary</strong></p>
            <p>I'm a scientist with a background in marine microbiology, biochemistry and plant science. And I've always been passionate about turning research into real-world solutions. During my <a href = "agrivoltaics.html" class = "inline-links">academic journey</a>, I've enjoyed diving deep into data, finding ways to streamline workflows, and using Python to make processes more efficient. Beyond the lab, I've had the chance to work with people from different fields, which has taught me the value of collaboration and clear communication. I've also loved sharing science with the public, whether through exhibits or as an interpreter, which has helped me connect with a wide range of people. As I look to the future, I'm excited about exploring opportunities in biotech and tech, where I can continue to learn and contribute to projects that make a difference.
