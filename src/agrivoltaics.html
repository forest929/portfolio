            <ul>
                <li>Investigated how different solar panel placements influence crop performance and energy efficiency, contributing to optimised agrivoltaic system design.</li>
                <li>Designed the data collection strategy, including a custom data entry form and a streamlined workflow for data analysis and visualisation. Developed Python scripts to automate data processing, created advanced visualisations to present key findings and shared these insights effectively with collaborators.</li>
                <li>Coordinate across departments and proactively seek support when needed to ensure field experiments were carried out on schedule and with the required resources.</li>
                <li>Collaborated extensively with academic researchers, industry partners and cross-functional teams to align research objectives, share knowledge and incorporate feedback, ensuring that the project remained on track and that findings were applied to real-world agrivoltaic solutions. This collaboration resulted in actionable insights that informed future designs for energy-efficient agricultural systems.</li>
